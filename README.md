# nhanes_cvd

This is a simple estimate of proportion of people with ALT < 60 U/L, in the subset of CVD patients with triglycerides < 500 and > 200 mg/dl, using NHANES data. This currently just uses one year of NHANES (2013-2014), and CVD is defined using the medical questionaire. People with heart failure are excluded.

The analysis report can be seen in [02_report.md](02_report.md), updated Feburary 5, 2018.
