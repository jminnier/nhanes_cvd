# Do you have any data about the range of ALTs in patients with TGs >200 mg/dL<500 mg/dL 
# and CVD? This is the patient population that we want to enroll into the new study with
# apoC-III LRx. Our cut off for enrollment is ALT<1.5xULN, and I assume the majority 
# of these patients should be with this cut off because this is not NAFLD, just 
# elevated TGs in CVD. However we got the question from the Agency about 
# representative patient population so I need more firm data.

In this presentation (https://www.heart.org/idc/groups/heart-public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_449847.pdf) it is defined as “Incidence of cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, or intermittent claudication; does not include hypertension alone)” and from the corresponding manuscript (http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/131/4/e29.long) “AP is based on the Rose Questionnaire; estimates are made regularly for HF; hypertension is based on BP measurements and interviews; and an estimate can be made for total CVD, including MI, AP, HF, stroke, and hypertension.” Creating a CVD yes/no definition from all these variables in different questionnaires might be the hardest part, unless you are looking for a specific type of CVD population?

Medical Conditions

MCQ160b - Ever told had congestive heart failure = NO
MCQ160c - Ever told you had coronary heart disease = YES
MCQ160d - Ever told you had angina/angina pectoris = YES
MCQ160e - Ever told you had heart attack = YES
MCQ160f - Ever told you had a stroke = YES

LBXSATSI  = "Alanine aminotransferase ALT (U/L)" < 1.5*40 U/L
LBXSTR  = "Triglycerides (mg/dL)"  > 200 and < 500 mg/dL

Rose questionnaire - CDQ
from: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/CDQ_H.htm
not sure what (if any) variables to use from this? mostly defines Angina

Demographics
From: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/demo_h.htm
RIAGENDR - Gender - separate into male/female?
RIDRETH3 - Race/Hispanic origin w/ NH Asian - do I need to restrict by race?
RIDAGEYR - Age in years at screening - do I need to restrict by age?

Blood pressure:
This section provides data for three consecutive blood pressure (BP) measurements and other methodological measurements to obtain an accurate blood pressure.

- I do not know how to define "intermittent claudication" with these variables
- do I need to look for hypertension?
